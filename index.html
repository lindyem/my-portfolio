      <div class="para1">I am an educator and developer from the midwest. I called Mexico home for 10 years and have recently made the transition to San Diego. My journey into tech started through my years in education. The future comes quickly and it was important to me to have the skills and tools to keep up. I love helping students inside the classroom and wanted to be able to help outside the classroom as well.</div>
      <div class="para2">Moving forward I want to combine my love of education with my new love of front-end development and instructional design. As a bilingual educator, English and Spanish, and my background in curriculum development, educational philosophy and project management skills, I hope to keep building bridges and creating content in my community through web design and e-learning experiences.</div>
